You can generate an HM point to cause a firestorm to leap to life around you. All creatures within 60 feet of you take 1 fire damage at the start of each of their turns. In addition, on your turn you can take an action to either: * Create a wall of fire that stretches up to 6 contiguous squares and deals 2 damage to any creature that starts their turn next to it or crosses it * Blast a creature with fire, making a spell attack against their Acrobatics defense and dealing 2 damage on a successful hit, 1 on a glance, 0 on a miss
