You can generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Points|Fate Point]] to cause the earth to sunder, split and shake in a [[Long]] radius sphere around you. All creatures in the area must make an [[Athletics]] check at the start of their turn or be knocked prone. For 10 ticks, you can raise or lower the level of a 10-foot-square patch of earth in the area by a number of feet equal to **10 * your [[Proficiency#Proficiency Bonus]]**.
