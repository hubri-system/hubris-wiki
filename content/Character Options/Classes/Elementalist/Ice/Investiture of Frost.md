You can spend a [[Action Resolution#Hero Points|Hero Point]] to become wreathed in rime. You become [[Damage#Immunity|Immune]] to damage, and gain a freezing aura that slows all creatures within 10 feet of you, causing all their actions to take an additional number of ticks equal to your [[Attributes#Charisma [CHA]]] score.
