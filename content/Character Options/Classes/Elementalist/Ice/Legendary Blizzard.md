You can generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Points|Fate Point]] to create a swirling blizzard. All other creatures within [[Long]] range of you are [[Conditions#Slowed]] and [[Conditions#Blinded]]. On your turn, you can make a [[Attributes#Charisma [CHA]]] roll against a target's [[Playing the Game/Skills/Endurance|Endurance]] defence for 10 ticks. If it fails, it becomes [[Conditions#Immobile|Immobilized]]. If it's already [[Conditions#Immobile|Immobilized]], it becomes restrained. If it's already restrained, it becomes [[Conditions#Paralyzed]].
