You can generate an HM point to create a swirling blizzard. All other creatures within 60 feet of you are slowed (extra ticks for actions equal to your CHA) and blinded. On your turn, you can make a spell attack against a target's endurance defence for 10 ticks. If it fails, it becomes immobilized. If it's already immobilized, it becomes restrained. If it's already restrained, it becomes paralyzed
