You can spend a Hero Point to become wreathed in a storm. You gain a fly speed equal to your walking speed, and gain an Aura that causes all creatures within 10 feet of you to need to make Athletics checks at the start of each of their turns or else be knocked prone or pushed back 10 feet (your choice).Â Missile attacks against you also have disadvantage.
