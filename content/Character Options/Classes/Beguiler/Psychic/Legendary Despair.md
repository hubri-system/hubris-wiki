Whenever you cause a creature to gain [[Action Resolution#Disadvantage]] on a check, you may generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Points|Fate Point]]. If you do, the creature has [[Action Resolution#Disadvantage]] on checks until it fails one. Once it fails one, it also loses its [[Proficiency#Proficiency Bonus]] to all checks. Once it fails two, it also can no longer get pure successes, only partial successes and failures. Once it fails three, it becomes incapable of taking any actions. This ends only once the creature takes a [[Downtime#Long Rest]].
