Whenever you grant a creature [[Inspiration]], you can generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Point]]. If you do, the creature has [[Proficiency#Expertise]] on the check, and generates a [[Action Resolution#Hero Points|Hero Point]] on a roll of 14 or higher. In addition, if the creature already had [[Action Resolution#Advantage]], roll 5d6 and take the 3 highest.
