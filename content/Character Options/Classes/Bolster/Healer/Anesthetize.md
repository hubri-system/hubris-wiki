You can attempt a difficult (DC 20) [[Medicine]] check to heal a creature mid-combat. The creature spends no [[Health & Stamina#Hit Dice [HD]|Hit Dice]] and heals no [[Health & Stamina#Hit Points [HP]|Hit Points]], but ignores all injuries it has. If you fail the roll, the above happens, but the creature also loses one hit point.
