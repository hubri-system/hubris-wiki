Whenever you use a power, you can draw on the life energy of your allies, dealing a point of damage to each of them. You may choose to draw energy from 1 or more allies within 30 feet of you. The effects of this feature depend on the number of allies you draw from.

| Allies | Effect                                                    |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Advantage on your [[Powers\|Power]] roll                  |
| 2      | Use a [[Powers\|Power]] you do not know as if you knew it |
| 3      | Expertise on your [[Powers\|Power]] roll                  |
| 4+     | [[Powers\|Power]] cannot fail, only [[Powers#Miscast]]    |
