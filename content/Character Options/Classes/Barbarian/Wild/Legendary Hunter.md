You can generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Points|Fate Point]] to designate a creature as your prey. Until it is defeated, you deal an extra point of [[Damage]] to it with every [[Attacking|Attack]], have [[Action Resolution#Advantage]] on rolls to track it, and [[Action Resolution#Advantage]] on injury rolls against it.
