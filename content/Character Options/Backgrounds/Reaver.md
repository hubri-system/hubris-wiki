As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you're well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit hired by state actors to complement their own armies, or with a smaller mercenary organization. You might have even been a gladiator, fighting for popular entertainment in the ring or the pit.
