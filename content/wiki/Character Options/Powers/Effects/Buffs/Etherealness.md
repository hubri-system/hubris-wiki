The target steps into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane. While in the Ethereal, the target may only affect and be affected by creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive or interact with the target, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so. The target can see and hear the plane they originated from, but they perceive it in shades of grey and can see no more than 60 feet. The target ignores all objects and effects not on the Ethereal Plane.
