Whenever you cause a creature to gain disadvantage on a check, you can generate an HM point. If you do, the creature has disadvantage on checks until it fails one. Once it fails one, it also loses its proficiency bonus to all checks. Once it fails two, it also can no longer get pure successes, only partials and failures. Once it fails 3, it becomes incapable of taking any actions. This ends only once the creature takes a long rest.
