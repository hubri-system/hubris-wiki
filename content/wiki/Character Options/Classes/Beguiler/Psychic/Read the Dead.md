Whenever a creature dies, you can use a 3 tick reaction to make an insight check to probe its mind. On a successful spellcasting roll against the target’s Composure defense, you gain access to a snapshot of the creature’s surface thoughts at the moment of its death, but also deeper probing, as Detect Thoughts.
