You can generate an HM point to create a tempest in a 60 foot radius sphere around yourself. All creatures in the sphere gain a fly speed that only you can control on your turn. Their movement via the fly speed does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Whenever anyone makes a missile attack through the storm, you choose whether to give the attack advantage or disadvantage
