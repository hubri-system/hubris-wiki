You create the Philosopher's Stone. You can generate an HM point to gain one of the following benefits: * The stone preserves a transmutation spell you can cast within it, allowing any creature to gain the benefit of the spell. You still make the spellcasting roll, but each additional application automatically succeeds. They count against those creatures spell limits. It can only preserve one such spell at a time. * You can transmute any object that fits into a 5-foot cube into any other object of the same volume. You must be familiar with both objects. * You can Crack open the stone, rendering it inoperable until the next long rest. Up to 5 creatures you designate can regain hit points as though they had spent a Hit Die
