Attribute: "[[Attributes#Charisma [CHA]|Charisma]]"
Skill:
  - "[[Composure]]"
---
You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.

> If you fail a check, you can attempt a DC 17 [[Composure]] check. If you succeed, you can re-attempt the roll, with advantage. If you fail, or fail the subsequent check, you take a hit point of damage, with no injury.
