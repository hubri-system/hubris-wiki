## Attacks
In HUBRIS, characters may make different kinds of attacks, depending on the kinds of outcomes they want to accomplish.
### Standard
[ticks::10]
You make an attack. Roll half your [[Attributes#Strength [STR]|STR]] score for damage.
### Light
[ticks::7]
You make a one-handed attack. Roll half your [[Attributes#Strength [STR]|Strength]] score for damage.

### Heavy
[ticks::13]
You make a two-handed attack. Roll 1.5 x your [[Attributes#Strength [STR]|Strength]] score for your damage roll.


## Hitting the Mark
The outcome of an attack is determined by whether the attacker met or exceeded the defender's [[Defending#Armor Class [AC]|Armor Class]]. There are three possible attack outcomes in HUBRIS: hits, glancing hits, and outright misses.
