When wielding a [[Attacking#Light]] melee weapon and no shield, you can use your reaction to counter a hit or [[Attacking#Glance]] against you. The DC is the attack roll, and you make a weapon attack against it. If you glance with the attack, it reduces the severity by 1 (Hit → Glance, Glance → Miss).
