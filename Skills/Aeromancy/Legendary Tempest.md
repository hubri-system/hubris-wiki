You can generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Points|Fate Point]] to create a tempest in a [[Long]] radius sphere around yourself. All creatures in the sphere gain a [[Movement#Flying]] speed that only you can control on your turn. Their movement via this flying speed does not provoke [[Movement#Opportunity Attacks]]. Whenever anyone makes a #ranged attack through the storm, you choose whether to give the attack [[Action Resolution#Advantage]] or [[Action Resolution#Disadvantage]].
