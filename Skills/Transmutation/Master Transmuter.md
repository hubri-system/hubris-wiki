At the end of a [[Downtime#Short Rest]], you can change one material in one item you can touch into another, similar material. For example, you could change a metal into another metal, or biomass of one kind (wood) into another (bone). You could also transmute incredibly dense wood (mahogany) into a very light metal (tin). This counts as using a power for the purposes of tracking [[Powers#Strain]].
