Whenever you kill a creature with a [[Character Options/Tags/Fire|Fire]] power, you can use your [[Structured Time#Reactions|Reaction]] to target another creature within a number of feet equal to **5 * your [[Proficiency#Proficiency Bonus]]**.Â  This does not count as a [[Powers|Power]] for the purposes of tracking [[Powers#Strain]].
