You have [[Action Resolution#Advantage]] on using [[Character Options/Tags/Cryomancy|Cryomancy]] powers that inflict the [[Conditions#Restrained]] condition. Whenever you affect a creature with an [[Character Options/Tags/Cryomancy|Cryomancy]] power, its speed in all [[Movement#Movement Modes]] is cut in half if the Power roll beats its [[Attributes#Constitution [CON]]] defense.
