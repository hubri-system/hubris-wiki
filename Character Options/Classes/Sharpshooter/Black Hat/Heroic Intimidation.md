You can spend a [[Action Resolution#Hero Points|Hero Point]] after an attack to give the target of the attack and all allies [[Action Resolution#Disadvantage]] on attacks against you and prevent them from moving towards you until the end of your next turn. If you have [[Proficiency#Expertise]] in [[Intimidation]], this effect instead lasts a number of turns equal to your [[Proficiency#Proficiency Bonus]].
