You can generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Points|Fate Point]] to create the Philosopher's Stone, and gain one of the following benefits: 
- The stone preserves a [[Transmutation]] power you can use within it, allowing any creature to gain the benefit of the spell. You still make the Power roll, but each additional application automatically succeeds. They count against those creatures spell limits. It can only preserve one such spell at a time. 
- You can transmute any object that fits into a 5-foot cube into any other object of the same volume. You must be familiar with both objects. 
- You can crack open the stone, rendering it inoperable until the next long rest. Up to 5 creatures you designate can regain [[Health & Stamina#Hit Points [HP]]] as though they had spent a [[Health & Stamina#Hit Dice [HD]|Hit Die]].
