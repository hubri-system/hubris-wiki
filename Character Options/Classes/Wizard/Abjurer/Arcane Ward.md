At the beginning of a [[Downtime#Long Rest]], and whenever you successfully use a power with the [[Abjuration]] tag, you gain an Arcane Ward. This ward has a [[Health & Stamina#Hit Points [HP]]] pool equal to your [[Proficiency#Proficiency Bonus]] and [[Damage#Vulnerability]] to all damage. You can use your [[Structured Time#Reactions|Reaction]] to interpose it against any attack against you within [[Short]] range.
