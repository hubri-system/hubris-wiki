Whenever a creature dies, you can use your [[Structured Time#Reactions|reaction]] for 3 ticks to make an [[Insight]] check to probe its mind. On a successful [[Attributes#Power [POW]]] roll against the target’s [[Composure]] defense, you gain access to a snapshot of the creature’s surface thoughts at the moment of its death, but also deeper probing, as [[Detect Thoughts]].
