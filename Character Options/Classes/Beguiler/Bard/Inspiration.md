You may spend a [[Health & Stamina#Hit Dice [HD]|Hit Die]] to grant [[Action Resolution#Advantage]] on a [[Skills|skill]] check to you or one of your allies that can see or hear you. On a success, the target gains [[Health & Stamina#Temporary HP [tHP]|tHP]] equal to a roll of the hit die you spent.
