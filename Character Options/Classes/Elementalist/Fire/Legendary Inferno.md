You can generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Points|Fate Point]] to cause a firestorm to leap to life around you. All creatures within [[Long]] range of you take 1 [[Character Options/Tags/Fire|Fire]] damage at the start of each of their turns. In addition, on your turn you can take an action to either:
- Create a wall of fire that stretches up to 6 contiguous squares and deals 2 [[Character Options/Tags/Fire|Fire]] to any creature that starts their turn next to it or crosses it .
- Blast a creature with fire, making a spell attack against their [[Playing the Game/Skills/Agility]] defense and dealing 2 [[Character Options/Tags/Fire|Fire]] damage on a successful hit, 1 on a [[Attacking#Glance]], and 0 on a miss.
