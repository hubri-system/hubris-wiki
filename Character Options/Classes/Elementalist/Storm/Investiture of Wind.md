You can spend a [[Action Resolution#Hero Points|Hero Point]] to become wreathed in a storm. You gain a [[Movement#Flying]] speed equal to your [[Movement#Walking]] speed, and gain an aura that causes all creatures within 10 feet of you to need to make [[Athletics]] checks at the start of each of their turns or else be knocked [[Conditions#Prone]] or pushed back 10 feet (your choice).Â Ranged attacks against you also have [[Action Resolution#Disadvantage]].
