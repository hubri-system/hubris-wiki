Whenever you take damage from a creature subject to your [[Compelled Duel]], you can use your [[Structured Time#Reactions|Reaction]] to generate a [[Action Resolution#Fate Points|Fate Point]]. If you do, it counts as though you had spent a [[Health & Stamina#Hit Dice [HD]|Hit Die]] to negate the damage.
