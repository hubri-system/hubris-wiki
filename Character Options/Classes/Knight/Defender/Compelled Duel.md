You can designate a creature as your opponent. You have [[Action Resolution#Advantage]] on all attacks against it, and it must either move towards you, attack you, or take an offensive action against you on each of its turns. You have [[Damage#Vulnerability]] to damage from it. You may only have one [[Compelled Duel]] at a time.
