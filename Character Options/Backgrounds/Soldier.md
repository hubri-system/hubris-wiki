War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.

> [!FEATURE] Relentless Endurance
> Whenever you would drop unconscious, you can make an [[Skills/Endurance|Endurance]] check, with the DC equal to (20 - 2* the number of HP you had before the attack).Â  If you succeed, you remain conscious at 1 HP, though any injury effects remain.
