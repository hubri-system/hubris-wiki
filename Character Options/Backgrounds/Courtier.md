In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.

Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.

| Rhetorical Minefield | Whenever you notice that someone is lying (through an [[Insight]] check or otherwise) you can attempt a [[Persuasion]] check to trap them conversationally, revealing the lie.                                       |
| Little White Lies    | Whenever you succeed on a [[Persuasion]] check to ingratiate yourself with someone, you can slip small lies about yourself or your companions into the conversation without having to attempt a [[Deception]] check. |
| Expert Deceiver      | Whenever you attempt a [[Deception]] check, you are aware of how well your lies landed, and what the sticking points are, if any.                                                                                    |
