You create an image of an object, creature, or visible phenomenon no larger than a 20-foot cube at a spot within range. The image seems completely real, including sound, smell, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted (though none of these attributes may cause damage or inflict conditions). While you are within range of the illusion, you may use a standard action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range, altering its appearance as you do so in order to make its movements appear natural. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature can use a standard action to examine the image, realizing its illusory nature on a successful Investigation check against your spell save DC. If a creature succeeds, it can see through the image, and its non-visual qualities become faint to the creature.
