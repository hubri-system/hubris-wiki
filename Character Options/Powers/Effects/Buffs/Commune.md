You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long- dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. On a successful casting, you can ask the entity up to five questions. The HM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the HM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.
