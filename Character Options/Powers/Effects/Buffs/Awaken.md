You touch a beast or plant. The target must have an Intelligence score of 3 or less. When you cast this spell, the target gains an Intelligence score of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to locomote and senses similar to a humanâ€™s. The target of the spell is charmed by you for 30 days, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.
