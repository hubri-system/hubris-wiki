### Hit Points [HP]
A character's Hit Points represent their physical hardiness--- how difficult it is to put them out of commission in a fight. Your hit points are determined by the following formula:
> (3 * [[Progression#Tiers|Tier]]) + [[Attributes#Constitution [CON]|CON]]
 
#### Temporary HP [tHP]
Temporary HP is exactly what it sounds like: an additional hit point pool that exists alongside your usual HP. The main advantage of tHP is that with it, you can (temporarily) possess a number of hit points beyond your usual maximum. You always deplete your tHP pool before subtracting damage from your usual HP, and tHP cannot bring a character up from zero.
