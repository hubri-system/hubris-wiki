## Armor Class [AC]
A creature's armor class determines how hard they are to hit. Various powers and abilities, as well as different kinds of armor, can modify this value. Your base AC while wearing no armor is equal to *10 + [[Attributes#Dexterity [DEX]|Dexterity]]*.

There are three types of armor in HUBRIS, each with different properties, advantages, and disadvantages. Your class determines the kinds of armor you are able to wear.
### Light
Light armor grants the wearer an AC of *10 + [[Proficiency#Proficiency Bonus|Proficiency Bonus]] + [[Attributes#Dexterity [DEX]|Dexterity]].*
### Medium
Medium armor grants the wearer an AC of *14 + [[Proficiency#Proficiency Bonus|Proficiency Bonus]]*.
### Heavy
Heavy armor grants the wearer an AC of *18 + [[Proficiency#Proficiency Bonus|Proficiency Bonus]]*. While wearing armor of this type, creatures have [[Action Resolution#Disadvantage]] on [[Dexterity]]-based checks.
